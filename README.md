## How to run
To use Candidate Ranking based on phonetic information (CandidateSelectionMethod.PHONETIC), make sure to have python3 and pip installed and run src/main/resources/bodu-spell/setup_venv.sh in your terminal (as "bash setup_venv.sh"). This will configure a virtual environment required for this method to work.
